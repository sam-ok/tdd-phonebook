Mocha is a javascript testing framework.
Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion framework for node.js and the browser that can be paired with any testing framework.
An assertion library is basically used to test if something is true or false.
Therefore, chai can help us test whether our tests are true or false.

Javascript has an inbuilt assertion library but chai offers more features.
Follow this https://openbase.com/categories/js/best-javascript-assertion-libraries?orderBy=RECOMMENDED& link 
for a collection of common javascript assertion libraries for both TDD and/or BDD tests.

When using Mocha, it looks for a directory named "test" which contains all our test files.
